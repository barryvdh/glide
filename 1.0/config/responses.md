# Responses

In addition to generating manipulated images, Glide also helps with creating HTTP responses using the `getImageResponse()` method. This is recommended over the `outputImage()` method, since it allows your application to handle the actual output of the image.

However, the type of response object needed depends on your application or framework. For example, you may want a PSR-7 response object if your using the Slim framework. Or, if you're using Laravel or Symfony, you may want to use an HttpFoundation object. To use the `getImageResponse()` method you must configure Glide to return the response you want.

- [PSR-7](config/responses#psr-7-responses)
- [HttpFoundation](config/responses#httpfoundation-responses)
- [CakePHP](config/responses#cakephp-responses)
- [Custom](config/responses#custom-responses)

## PSR-7 responses

Glide ships with a `PsrResponseFactory` class, allowing you to use any PSR-7 compliant library. However, since Glide only depends on the  PSR-7 interfaces, it cannot actually create the `Response` or `Stream` objects. Instead, you must provide them:

~~~ php
use League\Glide\ServerFactory;

$server = League\Glide\ServerFactory::create([
    'response' => new PsrResponseFactory(new Zend\Diactoros\Response(), function ($stream) {
        return new Zend\Diactoros\Stream($stream);
    }),
]);
~~~

However, for simplicity, Glide provides a few vendor adapters to make this easier:

~~~ php
use League\Glide\Responses\GuzzleResponseFactory;
use League\Glide\Responses\SlimResponseFactory;
use League\Glide\Responses\ZendResponseFactory;

$server = League\Glide\ServerFactory::create([
    'response' => new GuzzleResponseFactory(), // requires guzzlehttp/psr7
    'response' => new SlimResponseFactory(),   // requires slim/slim (> 3.0)
    'response' => new ZendResponseFactory(),   // requires zendframework/zend-diactoros
]);
~~~

## HttpFoundation responses

If your application uses Symfony's HttpFoundation library, you can use the `SymfonyResponseFactory`.

~~~ php
$server = League\Glide\ServerFactory::create([
    'response' => new League\Glide\Responses\SymfonyResponseFactory()
]);
~~~

## CakePHP responses

If your application uses the CakePHP framework, you can use the `CakeResponseFactory`.

~~~ php
$server = League\Glide\ServerFactory::create([
    'response' => new League\Glide\Responses\CakeResponseFactory()
]);
~~~

## Custom responses

If your particular project doesn't use PSR-7 or HttpFoundation, or if you'd like finer control over how your response objects are created, you can use your own response factories. Glide provides the `ResponseFactoryInterface` interface for this.

~~~ php
<?php

namespace League\Glide\Responses;

use League\Flysystem\FilesystemInterface;

interface ResponseFactoryInterface
{
    /**
     * Create the response.
     * @param  FilesystemInterface $cache The cache file system.
     * @param  string              $path  The cached file path.
     * @return mixed               The response object.
     */
    public function create(FilesystemInterface $cache, $path);
}
